In this notebook, I conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) focusing on the frequency of interactions among Amazon Prime users. The dataset utilized includes detailed information on 2,500 Amazon Prime subscribers, capturing their user interactions and subscription behaviors.

The analysis begins with fundamental steps such as loading and inspecting the data to understand its structure and completeness. Key fields like User ID, Name, Email Address, Subscription Plan, and various metrics related to user engagement and preferences are examined.

My objectives are to:

Gain insights into the demographic and behavioral patterns exhibited by Amazon Prime users.
Analyze the dynamics of subscriptions, including start and end dates, plan types, and renewal statuses.
Extract actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction and develop effective retention strategies.
Through the creation of visualizations to uncover underlying patterns and trends, as well as the application of segmentation techniques for user categorization, this notebook aims to not only provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing user base but also suggest strategies for future marketing initiatives and enhanced customer engagement.
